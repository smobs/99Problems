# 99Problems
Tests for https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

## How to use
Clone this repo.

Install [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html)

Run:
* Run `stack build` at the root of the repo.  This could take some time
* In `src/Solutions/` you will find unimplemented methods for each of the Haskell Problems.
* When you are happy with your implementation run `stack test` and see if your method is correct.
* Test passed? Great work.  Move onto the next problem (or you could try a different approach!)
* Test failed? Don't worry about it.  The failure should include an example case where your function doesn't work.  Try opening the repl (`stack ghci`) to work out what has gone wrong
