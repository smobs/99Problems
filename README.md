# 99Problems
Tests for https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

## How to use
Clone this repo.

Install [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html)
Run:
* `stack build` this could take some time
* `stack exec run-tests`

You should see a list of failing tests in the console.  These will be rerun everytime you save a file.

In `src/Solutions/` you will find unimplemented methods for each of the Haskell Problems.  Implement the method, pass the test and save the world :)
